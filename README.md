 Assignment 2: NLP and Python Programming Adventure

Note: We arenot able to upload out Output files on csv because of larger than 100MB. So we have uploaded all our file here in Onedrive as well. https://charlesdarwinuni-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/s383178_students_cdu_edu_au/Emk0EBn9aodNrBC96od-NiEBDiRKSdl2J-BIBOTiO5YpTQ?e=kMNJBM 
 
 **Overview**
This project demonstrates a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, image manipulation, and Python programming challenges. The assignment is divided into four main questions, each focusing on different aspects of programming and research.

Here's a diagram showing the process where students first push their code to a branch, followed by a code review, and finally merging into the main branch. This workflow ensures that changes are reviewed before being integrated into the main project.

** Question 1: NLP with CSV Data and Biomedical Models**
** Task 1: Extracting Text**
- Multiple CSV files containing large texts were processed, and all the text data was extracted and stored into a single `.txt` file.

** Task 2: Research and Installation of Libraries**
- Installed SpaCy, scispaCy, and models (`en_core_sci_sm` and `en_ner_bc5cdr_md`) for detecting biomedical entities like diseases and drugs.
- Installed Hugging Face Transformers and BioBERT for advanced biomedical text analysis.

 **Task 3: Word Frequency and Tokenization**
- 3.1: Counted the occurrences of words in the extracted text and listed the top 30 most common words, saving them in a CSV file.
- 3.2: Used the Auto Tokenizer function from the Transformers library to count unique tokens and listed the top 30 unique words.

** Task 4: Named-Entity Recognition (NER) Comparison**
- Performed NER using both SpaCy and BioBERT to extract entities such as diseases and drugs. The results from both models were compared based on the number of entities detected and key differences.

** Question 2: The Quest for the Hidden Treasure**
** Chapter 1: The Gatekeeper**
- An image manipulation task where pixel values were modified based on a generated number, and the sum of red pixel values in the new image was calculated.

** Chapter 2: The Chamber of Strings**
- Involved string manipulations and challenges using nested loops and conditions to solve puzzles in Python.
**
 Question 3: Code Decryption and Error Fixing**
- A code snippet encrypted using a certain pattern was decrypted. Once decrypted, errors in the original code were fixed and explained with detailed comments.

** Question 4: GitHub Collaboration**
- A public GitHub repository was created to collaborate with group members, and all contributions were tracked.

** Submission
- All programming files and outputs have been zipped and submitted along with the GitHub repository link.**
